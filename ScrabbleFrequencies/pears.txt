OK, nothings perfect, but, so far, the
buzz is that Harrow Sweet comes as
close as any pear I grow. It is very
extra sweet, which in our more northern
latitude can be a major issue where
pears often get inadequate sugar. The
Highlands are as sweet as Seckels this
year- the sweetest pear commonly grown
here.
